<p id="myname">Football is fun, challenging and exciting. Whenever I go home from school, I go outside to play football with my firends as we tackle and wrestle for the ball. I am 10 years old about to become 11 and I can throw a football as high as a house, far as 4 cars, and have good hair while doing all that amazing stuff. Typically everyone has a hero, so mine is my mom, and Patrick Mahomes, football MVP from 2018 to 2020 and star QB of the Texas Cheifs, amazing right? Playing football gives you a good body, mind, and you get stronger along the way occasionally.</p>
